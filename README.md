Abstract: This article examines the role of ritual and liminality in the context of the launch mount, drawing from a range of philosophical perspectives. The article explores the launch mount and its associated processes as ritualistic and liminal spaces, evoking a sense of wonder, transformation, and boundary-crossing for those who witness them. It also analyzes the ways in which these concepts contribute to our understanding of the religious, cultural and philosophical dimensions of space exploration.
Introduction
Our understanding of the universe - and our place within it - is both a testament to human ingenuity and a humbling reminder of the mysteries that remain. From the ancient Greeks, who grappled with the dichotomy between Plato's realm of ideal forms and Aristotle's empirical world, to the 12th-century Persian philosopher Shihab al-Din Suhrawardi, who conjured the poignant allegory of a bird whose perception of reality was constrained by its limited senses, philosophers have long been engaged in a quest to comprehend the unknown. This quest was given new dimensions by Immanuel Kant, who posited a reality beyond our grasp - the noumenon - that exists independent of our perception. Echoing Kant's noumenal realm in the contemporary era, thinkers such as Thomas Nagel, Quentin Meillassoux, and Graham Harman each propose their own interpretations of a reality that eludes our understanding. Nagel introduces the idea of subjective experiences that are fundamentally unknowable to us, using the example of a bat's consciousness to illustrate the inherent limitations of our own perspectives. Meillassoux, as part of the Speculative Realism movement, challenges the anthropocentric bias that permeates much of Western philosophy. He advocates for "contingent realism," arguing that reality exists in its own right, outside the confines of human cognition. Harman, also within the Speculative Realism movement, presents an object-oriented ontology, positing that objects - human, non-human, natural, or artificial - exist independently of our perception or comprehension. These philosophers broaden our perspective, reminding us that as we gaze into the cosmos, we are not merely looking outwards, but also inwards, probing the boundaries of our own understanding and consciousness. They lay a philosophical groundwork that enriches our contemplation of space exploration, setting the stage for the deeper explorations into the ritual and liminality of the launch mount that this series undertakes. The vast expanse of space becomes a mirror, reflecting our collective yearnings and fears, our insatiable curiosity, and our enduring struggle to reconcile the known with the unknown. It is within this grand cosmic theater, against the backdrop of the unending celestial ballet, that we seek to unravel the enigma of our existence. And as we do, the universe whispers back to us, in a language as ancient as time itself, in riddles and mysteries that test our alertness and cleverness, reminding us that we are, and always will be, part of this grand, enigmatic cosmic dance.
The dawn of the space age has brought about a profound transformation in human knowledge and experience, challenging our preconceived notions of what is possible and expanding our understanding of ourselves and our place in the universe. At the heart of this transformation lies the launch mount, a critical piece of infrastructure that enables the launch of spacecraft and the sending of humans and cargo into space.
This article is part of a larger series that explores the launch mount as a mirror of humanity, examining its impact on our understanding, interaction, and meaning-making. Divided into three articles, the series draws from a diverse range of philosophical perspectives to contribute to the growing body of research on the intersection of technology, culture, and ontology.
This second article investigates the role of ritual and liminality in the context of the launch mount. Drawing from the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Michel Foucault, Donna Haraway, Victor Turner, Catherine Bell, Victor Turner, Arnold Van Gennep, Ernest Becker, Judith Butler, Michel Foucault, Roy Rappaport, Arpad Szakolczai, Ronald Grimes, Mircea Eliade and Emile Durkheim, the article explores how these concepts shed light on the unique cultural and philosophical dimensions of space exploration.
In particular, the article focuses on the launch mount and its associated processes as ritualistic and liminal spaces, facilitating personal transformation and opening up new possibilities for human existence. It analyzes how Ronald Grimes and Arpad Szakolczai theories of ritual and liminality apply to the launch mount and contribute to our understanding of its significance. Finally, the article considers how these insights can inform our understanding of the religious, cultural and philosophical dimensions of space exploration, and the implications of these dimensions for human existence.
Series Context
Series Overview: The Launch Mount as a Mirror of Humanity
This article series delves into the question of what the launch mount can reveal about ourselves and the broader implications of the launch mount as a cultural and philosophical phenomenon. To address this question, the series is divided into three articles, each examining different aspects of the launch mount's impact on human understanding, interaction, and meaning-making. The series as a whole contributes to the growing body of research on the intersection of technology, culture, and ontology, drawing from a diverse range of philosophical perspectives.

Article 1: Stargate, Texas: Object Oriented Ontology at the End of the World.
This article explores the launch mount through various philosophers and theorists, including Martin Heidegger, Graham Harman, Clifford Geertz, Karen Barad, Sherry Turkle, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari, Isabelle Stengers, Donna Haraway, and Ernest Becker. Their concepts, such as Dasein, Object-Oriented Ontology, Interpretive Anthropology, Agential Realism, technology's impact on human relationships, Rhizomatic thinking, ecology of practices, Cyborg Theory, and Terror Management Theory, help understand the significance and impact of the launch mount and its network.

Article 2: Countdown to Immortality: Ritual and Liminality in the Age of Space Exploration
The second article will focus on the role of ritual and liminality in the context of the launch mount, drawing from the works of Arnold Van Gennep, Martin Heidegger, Catherine Bell, and Solomon et Al. The article will discuss the way that the launch mount and its associated processes function as ritualistic and liminal spaces, evoking a sense of wonder, transformation, and boundary-crossing for those who witness them.

Article 3: Celestial Soteriology and Postcolonialism
The final article will bring together theories of celestial soteriology and postcolonialism to examine the broader implications of the launch mount in a global context. The works of Timothy Morton, Ernest Becker, Neves Katca, and Fred Turner will be used to explore the ways in which the launch mount serves as a site of existential, political, and cultural negotiation, illuminating the complex interplay between technology, salvation, and the legacy of colonialism.
Literature Review

Arnold Gennep’s Rites of Passage (1909)
Gennep's seminal work, Rites of Passage, introduces the concept of liminality and examines the various stages of rituals within different cultures. He identifies three main stages in rites of passage: separation, liminality, and reintegration. These stages provide a framework for understanding the transformative nature of rituals, as individuals undergo transitions in social status, identity, or life stages.

Catherine Bell and Reza Aslan’s Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions (2009)
Bell's comprehensive analysis of rituals explores the different dimensions and perspectives of ritualistic practices across cultures. She proposes a performative approach to understanding rituals, emphasizing the importance of the participants' actions and the context in which the rituals take place. This work provides valuable insights into the role of ritual in shaping human experiences and the construction of social realities.

Roy Rappaport's Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity (1999)
Rappaport's influential work emphasizes the attempt to reconcile science and religion, highlighting the importance of ritual in connecting individuals to the collective power of shared existence. Drawing on Durkheim's theories, Rappaport argues that religion functions to bridge the gap between the known and the unknown, providing an anchor for human experience and helping to stabilize our interactions with the world. Through ritual, individuals can access and engage with the collective power of shared existence, which Durkheim refers to as "society" and "God." Rappaport's work underscores the importance of ritual in mediating our connection to the unknown and cultivating a sense of shared identity and meaning in an ever-changing world. This perspective can inform our analysis of the launch mount as a liminal and ritualistic space.

Victor Turner’s The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure (1969).
In his influential work, Victor Turner builds on Gennep's concept of rites of passage and liminality. Turner introduces the notion of "communitas," a sense of unity and shared identity that arises during liminal phases of rituals. He also discusses the role of symbols in rituals and the transformative power of liminality in social and cultural contexts.

Grimes, Ronald L. Ritual Criticism: Case Studies in Its Practice, Essays on Its Theory and "Deeply into the Bone: Re-Inventing Rites of Passage."
Ronald Grimes offers a comprehensive examination of ritual criticism, providing case studies and theoretical essays that explore the nature of ritual practices, performances, and their significance in human societies. In "Deeply into the Bone," Grimes delves into the topic of rites of passage, focusing on their role in marking significant transitions in individuals' lives and the social fabric.

Arpad Szakolczai’s "Liminality and Experience: Structuring Transitory Situations and Transformative Events." and Permanent Liminality and Modernity (2015, 2016)
Arpad Szakolczai's works investigate the concept of liminality and its relevance in understanding social transformations and modernity. In Permanent Liminality and Modernity, he argues that modernity can be seen as a state of permanent liminality, with constant change and fluidity in social and cultural systems. In "Liminality and Experience," Szakolczai explores how liminal situations and transformative events are structured, shedding light on the mechanisms and processes that underlie these phenomena.

Michel Foucault's "Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison" (1977) 
This paper by Foucault is a critical exploration of the societal transformation from corporal punishment to prison systems. It introduces the notion of 'disciplinary society,' where power is decentralized, diffused, and is not merely repressive but productive. Foucault examines the minute details of disciplinary mechanisms and how they construct 'docile bodies' suitable for the requirements of power. He argues that power is not just a tool wielded by the authority but a complex network of relationships permeating all levels of society. His 'panopticon' concept, a metaphorical illustration of constant surveillance leading to self-regulation, is particularly significant. His work underscores the subtleties of power dynamics and their manifestation in social interactions, contributing immensely to understanding the complexities of power and control.

Judith Butler’s Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative and Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity and Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of 'Sex'" (1997, 2011, 2011)
Butler's work on gender performativity and the subversion of norms is highly relevant to our analysis of rituals and gender within the context of space exploration. Her theories challenge traditional binary understandings of gender and highlight the performative nature of gender identity, providing insights into how gender norms are enacted, negotiated, and potentially transformed within ritualistic spaces.

Mircea Eliade's The Sacred and the Profane: The Nature of Religion (1959)
Eliade's exploration of the sacred and the profane, along with his concept of hierophany, offers a theoretical framework for interpreting the importance of rituals and liminal spaces in the realm of space exploration. Eliade's perspective on the human propensity for perceiving the extraordinary within the everyday illuminates the sense of awe and transcendence that space launch rituals can invoke. In this study, we borrow Eliade's concept of hierophany but reject his ethnocentric interpretation of "primitivism". This adaptation allows us to appreciate the universal human capacity for awe and transcendence that space launch rituals inspire while remaining critical of Eliade's restrictive perspective on other cultures.

Methodology
To explore the relationship between the Orbital Launch Mount (OLM) and the diverse network of human and non-human entities surrounding it, we employed a multi-method research design that combined ethnographic fieldwork, participant observation online, and an online survey.
Our ethnographic fieldwork consisted of participant observation conducted primarily online due to geographical constraints. We observed interactions, discussions, and behaviors within various online spaces, such as YouTube SpaceX fan channels, online forums, and social media platforms, that centered around the OLM and related SpaceX initiatives. This method allowed us to gain insights into the ways in which individuals engage with the OLM and the broader network of entities that surround it. Our observations helped us to identify key themes, patterns, and dynamics that emerged from these online interactions.
Online Survey
We developed an online survey targeted at YouTube SpaceX fan channel administrators, who were deeply involved and well-informed about the OLM and associated SpaceX projects. A total of 14 administrators completed the survey. The questions were designed to explore their perspectives on the OLM, their experiences and connections with the OLM and associated launches, and the ways in which they perceive the OLM's significance within the broader context of space exploration. The survey data provided additional insights into the complex web of relationships surrounding the OLM and helped to validate and complement our participant observation findings. 

Participant observation
We also conducted participant observation in various online spaces such as YouTube chat rooms, reviewing YouTube video comments, and engaging with the space exploration community on Reddit and Discord channels. This method allowed us to immerse ourselves in the online environment and engage with the community, enabling us to ask questions and gather valuable insights into the participants' perspectives on the OLM and related SpaceX initiatives. Through these interactions, we were able to identify the recurring themes, concerns, and values that emerged from these online discussions, further deepening our understanding of the complex relationships between the OLM and the various human and non-human entities that surround it.
Data Analysis
Our data analysis process involved the identification and interpretation of recurring themes and patterns that emerged from our ethnographic fieldwork, participant observation online, and the online survey. We employed a thematic analysis approach, which involved the identification, analysis, and interpretation of themes and patterns within our qualitative data. This approach allowed us to explore the complex web of relationships surrounding the OLM, drawing connections between the perspectives of various online participants and their engagement with the OLM and the broader network of entities that surround it.
Throughout the analysis, we drew upon the philosophical perspectives of Martin Heidegger, Arnold Gennep, Catherine Bell, Salomon et al., Mircea Eliade and Judith Butler to inform our understanding of the OLM as a site of liminality, interconnectivity, and existential anxiety. By synthesizing these authors’ perspectives… Append
Ethical Considerations
Given the sensitive nature of existential anxiety as a topic, we ensured that our research was conducted ethically and responsibly. We sought informed consent from all survey participants and maintained their anonymity throughout the research process. Additionally, we were mindful of the potential emotional impact of our research on participants and ensured that our engagement with them was respectful and considerate.
In our analysis and presentation of the research findings, we were also aware of the potential for misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the views and experiences of the online communities we engaged with. We took care to accurately and fairly represent their perspectives, acknowledging the diversity and complexity of views within these communities.
Limitations and Future Research
Our study faced certain limitations, such as the restricted access to participants and the geographical distance from the field. In future research, on-the-ground fieldwork and more strategic access to participants would help to overcome these challenges and potentially yield richer data. Incorporating interviews and academic voices, as well as exploring analogous situations in other regions, could further enhance our understanding of the complex relationships and dynamics surrounding the OLM and its broader significance in space exploration.
Findings and Argument Development
Theme 1 - Self Transformation and transcendence
Butler could also contribute significantly to a section on self-transformation

Michel Foucault - Although Foucault's ideas on power dynamics can fit into the rituals section, considering that power is often exercised and negotiated during rituals, his work might fit even better in a section discussing self-transformation, considering his focus on power relationships and the formation of the self.

Durkheim - The concept of 'collective effervescence' is related to the community bonding that can occur during rituals, but it can also be tied to self-transformation and transcendence, given that collective experiences can significantly influence individuals' emotions and sense of identity.

The concept of self-transformation and transcendence is a central theme in the works of Friedrich Nietzsche (1883, 1908), particularly in his concept of the Übermensch, or "superman," as a goal for individuals to strive towards in achieving a higher level of existence beyond traditional morality. Nietzsche's philosophy emphasizes the process of self-transcendence and becoming, rather than static being, as a means of overcoming limitations and achieving personal growth.
Martin Heidegger (1962) proposed a more nuanced approach to self-transcendence, in which individuals engage in a process of "authentic" self-discovery and self-expression that is rooted in their shared history and culture. He believed that this approach would allow individuals to transcend the limitations of their individual selves without losing sight of their connection to the larger world and to others.
Foucault's (2008) work emphasizes the idea of self-care and self-creation as a means of personal transformation and transcendence. He argues that individuals can transform themselves through practices of self-examination and self-discipline, which enable them to free themselves from dominant power structures and create new forms of subjectivity. Foucault also emphasizes the importance of historical and cultural context in shaping our understanding of ourselves and our potential for transformation.
Donna Haraway's (1991) work explores the intersections of technology, culture, and identity, and the ways in which technology can be used to transform the human body and mind. In her book Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature, she argues that the merging of technology and biology can enable individuals to transcend traditional boundaries of gender, race, and other forms of identity, and create new forms of being and belonging. She also emphasizes the importance of social and political context in shaping our relationship to technology and our potential for transformation. Her work can be applied to the ways in which space exploration and technology are transforming our understanding of ourselves and our place in the universe.
The concept of the limits of being can be found in the works of Victor Turner’s (2008) (2008) book The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure. Turner argues that liminality reveals the limits of established structures and categories, and allows individuals to imagine new possibilities for being and acting in the world. He emphasizes the importance of ritual and symbolic action in creating liminal spaces and facilitating the process of self-transformation.
Ethnography done - what role would you play?
With regards to the communal emotion engendered by space launches, Durkheim's concept of 'collective effervescence' could serve as a fitting descriptor. Durkheim explains this phenomenon as the intense energy and emotional response generated in collective gatherings, which can transcend individual experiences and contribute to a collective identity (Durkheim, 1912, p. 218). In the context of space launches, this communal energy is palpable as people around the world gather to watch these events, often erupting in cheers or applause at the successful launch of a rocket. This shared experience serves to not only validate the significance of space exploration but also fosters a sense of global unity and aspiration.
Theme 2 - Liminality
In her book Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions, Catherine Bell (2009) describes the liminal phase of rituals as a period of transition in which individuals or groups experience a sense of ambiguity and potentiality. In our case study, the sense of ambiguity and potentiality is palpable as the rocket launches make use of the countdown ritual catalyst. The massive forces and humanity involved, initiates a powerful liminal phase where individuals and groups experience a sense of heightened ambiguity and potentiality.
Victor Turner’s (2008) thoughts on liminality are valuable. He defines liminality as a state of being "betwixt and between" established structures or categories, in which individuals or groups experience a sense of ambiguity and potentiality. Liminality is often associated with rites of passage, such as initiation ceremonies, in which individuals undergo a transformative process and emerge as changed beings. 
Arnold Gennep's (2009) concept of liminality, as discussed in his work Rites of Passage, can be applied to the launch mount and its associated processes. The launch mount can be seen as a liminal space, in which individuals experience a sense of ambiguity and potentiality as they witness the transition from Earth to space. This liminal space can evoke a sense of wonder and transformation, as individuals confront the limits of their established categories and experience a sense of being "betwixt and between." 
Drawing on Gennep's framework and the notion of life and death rituals, we can see SpaceX launches as symbolizing humanity's potential to transcend its earthly boundaries and the limitations of mortality. The astronauts, representing the best of humanity, embark on a perilous journey, and their success or failure in reaching the stars reflects our collective aspirations to overcome the constraints of our existence. Separation: During the launch, the astronauts are physically and symbolically separated from the earth and the rest of humanity. They are elevated to a higher plane, as they embody the hope and potential of our species. Transition: The launch itself is a critical transition period, where the astronauts and their spacecraft are subject to immense risk. This stage echoes Gennep's notion of life and death rituals, as the success or failure of the mission symbolizes the potential for humanity to overcome its earthly limitations and mortality. In our instance, the launch pad acts multi-dimensionally as a load bearer in terms of weight, spacecraft workload, fuel storage, etc. Incorporation: Once the mission is completed and the astronauts return to Earth, they are reincorporated into society. Their journey serves as a testament to humanity's ability to reach for the stars and, on a deeper level, to potentially achieve salvation from the confines of our terrestrial existence. In this light, the launchpad acts as a nest of winged beings, leaving for a migration journey from which they will one day return from, the launch tower ready to embrace the spacecraft to its metal nest, with mechanized open arms.
TMT, or Terror Management Theory, can be seen as a way in which individuals navigate the uncertainty and potentiality of transitional phases in their lives, particularly in the context of psychological liminality. [Add Becker or others references] The theory suggests that awareness of mortality can motivate individuals to seek out sources of meaning and purpose, and engage in behaviors and beliefs that help them cope with the inherent uncertainties of life. Cultural and social factors play an important role in shaping how individuals cope with mortality and navigate psychological liminality, and different contexts may offer different sources of meaning and purpose.
The launchpad's status as a liminal space has far-reaching implications for our relationship with the cosmos, prompting us to reassess our place in the universe. As we continue to push the boundaries of space exploration, the launchpad serves as a constant reminder of our humble beginnings and our interconnectedness with the vast expanse of the universe. This recognition can foster a deeper appreciation for the cosmos and its mysteries, prompting us to approach space exploration with a sense of awe, humility, and reverence
Theme 3 - Rituals
Space launches, while primarily scientific and technological endeavors, take on a ritualistic character that resonates deeply with a range of audiences. These rituals, as laid out by Arnold Van Gennep (1909), can be framed as a three-part sequence: separation, liminality, and reintegration, which can be identified within the context of space exploration. The separation phase is marked by historical traditions. For instance, Russian cosmonauts pay their respects to the statue of Yuri Gagarin at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City before their launches. This act of homage symbolically separates them from their ordinary roles and prepares them for the liminal experience of space travel. (Quote that) The liminal phase, as Victor Turner (1969) describes, is a period of ambiguity and disorientation that occurs in the middle stage of rituals. Astronauts in the United States experience this liminal phase during the "Astro Breakfast" ritual, where individual breakfast food choices become a part of a communal meal, encouraging unity and reflection before the monumental journey. This liminal phase fosters a sense of "communitas," a shared identity that emerges during the liminal phases of rituals (Turner, 1969). The second component of Arnold Van Gennep, liminality, [recap from previous theme section] and reintegration. [Discuss this with some authors that were in previous themes but never re-mentioned and not mentioned later]

[Needs an intro because it is like a feminist subsection] The propagation of gendered language and practices, such as referring to tools as 'man-lifts' or describing the workforce as 'manpower', both mirrors and fortifies societal norms and expectations. As Butler states in 'Excitable Speech', "The power of discourse to produce that which it names is well known in the performative tradition". This implies that gender norms are not unalterable, but are continually enacted and reinforced through speech and behavior. 
Yet, these customs and practices, while ostensibly consolidating traditional gender norms, also present opportunities for subversion and transformation. Drawing from Butler's subsequent work, 'Bodies That Matter', we can understand how the repetition of these customs can become a stage for negotiating and redefining gender norms. As Butler posits, "The critical promise of drag does not have to do with the proliferation of genders, as if a sheer increase in numbers would do the job, but rather with the exposure or the failure of heterosexual regimes ever fully to legislate or contain their own ideals". Therefore, the performance of gender within the context of space exploration is not merely a reinforcement of norms, but can also be an arena for potential transformation and resistance.
A significant aspect of these rituals is the presence of wildlife around the launch site. The birds, with their ancient rituals of song and dance, symbolize a parallel world that exists alongside the human world of technology and progress. Their symposium, where males display their nests in hopes of attracting a mate, is juxtaposed with the symposium of the world's most powerful humans showcasing their technological prowess. This interplay accentuates the coexistence of natural and technological worlds and serves as a poignant reminder of our obligations to both. (Quote from Greek History Source)
Furthermore, the propagation of gendered language and practices, such as referring to tools as 'man-lifts' or describing the workforce as 'manpower', both mirrors and fortifies societal norms and expectations. Butler's analysis reveals the far-reaching implications of challenging traditional gender norms. According to Butler, if gender norms were to be destabilized, it would lead to the proliferation of diverse gender configurations, undermining the stability of fixed identities and dismantling the central roles of "man" and "woman" in narratives of compulsory heterosexuality. The performative repetition of gender, particularly in parodic forms, exposes the illusion that gender identity is an inherent and unchangeable essence. Instead, gender is seen as a social act that is susceptible to fragmentation, self-parody, self-criticism, and exaggerated displays of "naturalness," which ultimately reveal its fundamentally constructed and illusory nature.
Yet, these customs and practices, while ostensibly consolidating traditional gender norms, also present opportunities for subversion and transformation. Drawing from Butler's subsequent work, 'Bodies That Matter', we can understand how the repetition of these customs can become a stage for negotiating and redefining gender norms.
During launches, attendees participate in personal rituals such as taking photographs with starships or collecting mementos. These tangible artifacts aid individuals in reintegrating their liminal experiences back into their everyday lives, thereby strengthening their connection with the event.
Furthermore, Butler's theory sheds light on how these practices, while seemingly reinforcing traditional gender norms, also open up possibilities for subversion and transformation. As these rituals are performed and repeated, they become sites for negotiation and reinterpretation of gender norms. For instance, the growing presence and visibility of women in the field of space exploration disrupts the traditionally male-dominated narrative.
When discussing power dynamics and resistance in the context of the YouTube chatroom, we can draw upon Judith Butler's insights, as well as the work of Michel Foucault, who has greatly influenced Butler's theories. Butler's work on power and resistance highlights how power operates through the establishment of norms and the imposition of identity categories. Foucault, on the other hand, emphasizes that power is not a simple, oppressive force exerted by those in authority onto the oppressed, but a complex network of relationships permeating all layers of society. This perspective can illuminate the more subtle ways in which power dynamics manifest in the chatroom. In her book "Gender Trouble," Butler argues that power not only represses but also produces and regulates identities through performative acts. She further suggests that resistance can be found in challenging and subverting these norms and categories. By using indigenous languages and questioning topic restrictions, participants in the chatroom can engage in acts of resistance that disrupt the power dynamics at play but they also risk getting banned by the moderators.
Recurring events like the "Crowfest" further solidify the ritualistic experience. These events, featuring activities like dancing, communal meals, and collective speculation, reinforce the sense of community and shared humanity.
The commercial aspects of space launches add an economic dimension to these rituals. Merchandising strategies that include selling apparel, starship memorabilia, and themed coffee mugs allow individuals to tangibly participate in the event. The purchase and possession of these items become part of the ritual, enhancing the overall experience.
The rituals associated with space launches serve as a lens to examine the intersection of gender, technology, and the natural world. The interplay of these elements, as evidenced in the shared symposium of birds and humans, and the gendered language and practices, underscores the rich socio-cultural complexity of these events. Incorporating Butler's perspective enriches our understanding of these rituals, revealing the ways in which they both reflect and shape societal norms, and hinting at the potential for transformation. 
Rituals surrounding space launches serve a multitude of purposes. They foster social bonding, anticipation, and a sense of community among viewers. They also connect individuals with the marvels of space exploration through shared experiences and symbolic actions. This ritualistic aspect of space launches encapsulates their socio-cultural significance, reflecting our shared human inclination to explore, innovate, and discover. Drawing on Mircea Eliade's concept of "primitivity" and "hierophany," these rituals testify to the enduring human capacity for wonder and engagement and the manifestation of the extraordinary within the ordinary world. They embody a deeply human capacity for wonder, and a desire to reach beyond the known and the ordinary, tapping into a profound sense of awe and transcendence.
